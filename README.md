# Doodle_classification
# Introduction
This project is about classifying doodle images into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset used for training and evaluation was collected from the Google Cloud website, which provides a diverse collection of labeled doodle images.

# Dataset
The doodle dataset obtained from the Google Cloud website consists of various categories of doodle images. Each category contains a substantial number of labeled images, making it suitable for training a CNN model.
